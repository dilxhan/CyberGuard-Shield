# Machine learning based web application firewall

Create a web application firewall using machine learning to detect and prevent attacks like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and shell script injections. The project has the following requirements:

- Use Python 3.x as the primary programming language.
- Utilize Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation.
- Depend on various Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.
- Set up a Node.js environment to run a demo server.
- The development process is divided into several Jupyter notebooks, including data wrangling, data cleaning, and data analysis, training, evaluation, and model saving.

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook on your system.
2. Open your command prompt and type: `jupyter notebook <notebookfile.ipynb>` to open a specific notebook.
3. Progress through the notebook's sections by either pressing Ctrl+Enter or using the toolbar options.

Additionally, there's a demo server containing the best classifier implemented as a .pickle file, which allows for live testing. Refer to the README.md in the demo server for instructions on setting up the server.

In summary, this project involves creating a web application firewall using machine learning techniques, with a development process outlined in Jupyter notebooks and a live demo server for testing the implemented classifier.
